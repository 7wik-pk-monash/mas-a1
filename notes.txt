training:
figure out a way to count how many times all 4 agents have finished pickups and dropoffs - and display that at the end of each training epoch (or store in a file)
store steps of each of the 4 agents on top of total steps - store prev versions of these 4 numbers - compare prev and curr numbers - if these turn out to all be equal 
8 times in a row, terminate epoch

store moves of each agent when testing - in a dict?

defn of done:
all 4 agents must switch reached_a at least twice
look into eps decay - sus
