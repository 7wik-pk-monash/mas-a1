training:
figure out a way to count how many times all 4 agents have finished pickups and dropoffs - and display that at the end of each training epoch (or store in a file)
store steps of each of the 4 agents on top of total steps - store prev versions of these 4 numbers - compare prev and curr numbers - if these turn out to all be equal 
8 times in a row, terminate epoch

store moves of each agent when testing - in a dict?
start agents of random types from random locs in each epoch

defn of done:
all 4 agents must switch reached_a at least twice
look into eps decay - sus

rewards 25s, -12s = 40.7
12s -12s = c:c 1:3 and terrible perf

1e-3 25s and -12 = 29.2%
# running 50s and -25 2e-4 terrible

1e-3 25s, cyc 25, -12 = 25%

100s and -50s = 62% on fixed a and b but different a => goes for a toss

eps decay of 0.99997 for 4.5k epochs
